## Challenges we ran into 👀
The most challenging part was to configure tailwind.css with ReactJS as many files had to be generated and edited. Also, another challenge was to deploy our web app online and configure our frontend to make API requests with the backend as we were deploying a Django app for the first time.

## What we learned 💯
We learned the whole Django rest framework for this project. We also got to know to how to configure tailwind.css with ReactJS. We used Twilio's sendgrid API for the first time.

## How we used Firebase Cloud Storage 🔥
When a user records their video to submit it to their application, our web app uploads it to the cloud storage and shows it on the company dashboard.

## How we used Twilio 🎈
When a company schedules an interview, our web app generates a unique link for the applicants to submit their application. When we click on the share the link button, our webapp along with Twilio's sendgrid api, sends a mail to the applicants inviting them to give the job interview along with the unique link. Also, when a user submits his/her application, the company can state whether the applicant has passed or failed and our web app sends them a mail informing about the same.
